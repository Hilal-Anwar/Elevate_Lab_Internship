## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (High-Level)

1. **Substitution layer**  
   Special Unicode placeholders temporarily replace patterns such as `*-` or `/-` so the parser can safely split on operators without confusing leading negatives.
2. **Parsing**  
   - Expression is first split on `+` (after converting subtraction to `+-` form).  
   - Each segment is recursively processed for `*`, `/`, `^`, and `!`.
3. **Evaluation**  
   - Uses `double` arithmetic for general operations.  
   - Factorials switch to `BigInteger` to avoid overflow.  
   - Final result is the summation of all processed segments.
4. **REPL loop** for continuous user interaction.
